# Radiology Image Viewer

This is a simple web application for viewing a stack of radiology images. The application allows the user to scroll through the images using a vertical scrollbar, and provides buttons for adjusting the brightness and contrast, zooming, and panning the images. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and runs on a Python web server. Creating was assisted by ChatGPT.

## Getting Started

To run the application, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website.

Once you have Python installed, follow these steps:

Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Start the Python web server by running the following command:
```
python server.py
```
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/.
You should now see the radiology image viewer application.

## Usage

To use the application, follow these steps:

Scroll through the image stack using the vertical scrollbar to the right of the canvas.
Adjust the brightness and contrast of the image using the "Brightness/Contrast" button. Click and drag the mouse to adjust the brightness and contrast.
Zoom in and out of the image using the "Zoom" button. Click and drag the mouse to zoom in and out. The focal point of the zoom will be where the initial mouse click was.
Pan the image using the "Pan" button. Click and drag the mouse to pan the image.
To reset the image to its original state, click the "Reset" button.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance and functionality of the application by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. For example, you can change the background color of the toolbar or the canvas, or add additional buttons for other image manipulation tasks.
